	    <p>Documendz collects private user information which  is used to improve the content on the Documendz website and the quality of our service, and is not shared with or sold to other organizations for commercial purposes, except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission.</p>
	    <p>We may use your information to send you a welcoming email that may confirm your email, or other important transactional emails related to your use of the Services. In addition, if you identify yourself to us by sending us an email with questions or comments, we may use your information (including personally identifiable information) to respond to your questions or comments, and we may file your questions or comments for future reference. We may also use the information collected to send you important service announcements and updates regarding the Services or, if applicable, about your billing account status.</p>
	    <p>We may also use the information gathered to perform statistical analysis of user behavior or to evaluate and improve the Services. We may link some of this information to personally identifiable information for internal purposes or to improve your experience with the Services.
Our Services do not collect personally identifiable information which is included in the documents uploaded or used by you within the Services.
We may provide to third parties non-personally identifiable information, typically combined with similar information of other users of the Services. For example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of unique users who use the Services, the demographic breakdown of our users of the Services, or the products and/or services purchased using the Services and the vendors of such products and services. We may also provide to third parties personally identifiable information. For example, we might share our users' responses to questionnaires and e-mail addresses with third parties in order for third parties to contact users about products and services that may be of interest. The third parties to which we may provide personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information may include potential or actual advertisers, providers of advertising products or services (including vendors and website tracking services), merchants, affiliates and other actual or potential commercial partners, sponsors, licensees, researchers and other similar parties.</p>
